## Working Experience

#### Neonode Technologies (Stockholm · Aug 2021 - Present · ~4 yrs)
I'm currently working in the computer vision team at Neonode. We are developing a Driver Monitoring System for the automotive industry. I lead the team that creates synthetic data and I also play an important role in the machine learning team. I rebuilt our entire synthetic data pipeline, which made it faster and more modular by utilizing reusable components. I parallelized the rendering on multiple cores and distributed it on a render farm that I set up in Linux. This increased the output performance by 5x (Reference #1). I also created a Python- and TensorFlow-based framework and tooling for our ML team to handle data augmentation, model training, and evaluation. I focused on making it modular and reusable to improve iteration time and ease the setup of new models. For two of our neural networks, I’m fully responsible—doing everything from rigging in Maya to training and evaluating against real-world data.

#### byBrick Interface (Västerås · Jun 2011 - Aug 2021 · 10 yrs 3 mos)
byBrick Interface is a digital agency that primarily focuses on B2B marketing and training simulators for large industrial companies. I worked mainly with interactive sales apps, VR experiences, and simulators for desktops and tablets. Doing both the programming and 3D work. I also worked with animation and compositing. One example where I used my visual skills was when I created a Virtual Reality apartment tour of an unbuilt property in Unreal Engine. Seeing real-time changes to flooring, wall colors, and cabinetry made it significantly easier for customers to decide. (Reference #2). In another project, I helped a customer assemble hundreds of different crane configurations from CAD data. Using my expertise in 3D mathematics, automation, and problem-solving. (Reference #3)

#### Care of Haus (Västerås · May 2010 - Jun 2011 · 1 yr 2 mos)
Care of Haus is the top marketing agency in my hometown Västerås. I participated in their trainee program where three other developers and I ran a small agency mainly focusing on web development.
